My name is Asiye Deniz. 
I graduated from Ege University, Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies . I completed my master's degree in the same field. I have been working as a teacher at the Ministry of National Education (MEB) since 2008. I took part in various projects such as digital content development, curriculum preparation, and book writing. My interest in programming and software has always continued. I am interested in Software Development and Data Science. I am a hard-working, honest and outspoken person who has a sense of work discipline and responsibility. I can carry out both individual and group work. I am open to learning and innovations.
